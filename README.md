- **Dataset**  
  Sample data of 100 users divided into control and treatment groups.
- **README.md**  
  Documentation, installation guides, and usage instructions.

## Getting Started
1. **Install dependencies**  
   Ensure you have Python 3.x and the following libraries installed:
   - Pandas
   - Numpy
   - Matplotlib
   - Seaborn
   - Scipy
   - Jupyter Notebook

2. **Set up environment**

## Methodology
1. **Problem Definition**  
   Identifies the objectives and key questions to be answered through statistical analysis.
   
2. **Data Collection**  
   A sample of 100 users is divided into:
   - Control Group: 50 users using the current website.
   - Treatment Group: 50 users using the redesigned website.

3. **Statistical Analysis**  
   - **Time Spent Analysis**: Compares the time users spend on the new vs. old landing pages.
   - **Conversion Rate Analysis**: Tests if the new design improves the conversion rate.
   - **Language Dependency**: Examines if conversion status depends on the preferred language.
   - **Time Spent by Language**: Analyzes if time spent on the new page varies by language.

4. **Results & Insights**  
   Provides conclusions and actionable recommendations based on the statistical findings.

## Key Questions Addressed
1. Do users spend more time on the new landing page than on the existing one?
2. Is the conversion rate higher for the new design compared to the old one?
3. Does the conversion status depend on the preferred language?
4. Is the time spent on the new page consistent across different language users?
